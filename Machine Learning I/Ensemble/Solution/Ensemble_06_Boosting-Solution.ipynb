    "The basic principle behind the working of the boosting algorithm is to generate **multiple weak learners** and **combine** their predictions to form one strong rule. These weak rules are generated by applying base Machine Learning algorithms on different distributions of the data set. These algorithms generate weak rules for each iteration. After multiple iterations, the weak learners are combined to form a strong learner that will predict a more accurate outcome."

    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. A subset is created from the original dataset.\n",
    "- 2. Initially, all data points are given equal weights.\n",
    "- 3. A base model is created on this subset.\n",
    "- 4. Use this model to make predictions on the whole dataset.\n",
    "- 5. Errors are calculated using the actual values and predicted values.\n",
    "- 6. The observations which are incorrectly predicted, are given higher weights.\n",
    "- 7. Another model is created and predictions are made on the dataset. (This model tries to correct the errors from the previous model)\n",
    "- 8. Similarly, multiple models are created, each correcting the errors of the previous model.\n",
    "- 9. The final model (strong learner) is the weighted mean of all the models (weak learners).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the boosting algorithm combines a number of weak learners to form a strong learner. The individual models would not perform well on the entire dataset, but they work well for some part of the dataset. Thus, each model actually **boosts** the performance of the ensemble, hence the name **Boosting**.\n",

    "XGBoost (extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. XGBoost has proved to be a highly effective ML algorithm, extensively used in machine learning competitions and hackathons. XGBoost has high predictive power and is almost **10 times faster** than the other gradient boosting techniques. It also includes a variety of regularization which reduces overfitting and improves overall performance. Hence it is also known as **regularized boosting** technique."

    "\n",
    "- **Regularization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard GBM implementation has no regularisation like XGBoost.\n",
    "Thus XGBoost also helps to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallel Processing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost implements parallel processing and is faster than GBM .\n",
    "XGBoost also supports implementation on Hadoop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Flexibility**:\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost allows users to define custom optimization objectives and evaluation criteria adding a whole new dimension to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost has an in-built routine to handle missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree Pruning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost makes splits up to the max_depth specified and then starts pruning the tree backwards and removes splits beyond which there is no positive gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Built-in Cross-Validation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost allows a user to run a cross-validation at each iteration of the boosting process and thus it is easy to get the exact optimum number of boosting iterations in a single run."
